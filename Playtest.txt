controlls:

ctrl: Crouch and hovering in air
Spacebar: Jump
wasd and arrowkeys: directional movement
1: mode 1 direct velocity and direct stop
2: mode 2 slow const acceleration fast const deacceleration
3: mode 3 ease in acceleration and const deacceleration


Playtest:

my personal prefrense was mode 2 slow const acceleration fast const deacceleration. It looked more appealing to the eye for me.
the other 2 modes worked as well but didnt feel good in my opinion ease in was ver slow and direct velocity just didnt feel natural.
other then that very fun experience:)
